# Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## 📌 Objective
To understand what makes a password strong by creating multiple passwords of varying complexity, testing them using online password strength checkers, and analyzing the results.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **[Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com/)**
- **[Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)**

---

## 📝 Steps Followed

### 1. Understanding Strong Password Requirements
- Minimum **12–16 characters** long
- Combination of **uppercase & lowercase letters**
- Inclusion of **numbers** and **special symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words**, personal info, or predictable patterns

### 2. Creating Test Passwords
We created multiple passwords of different complexity levels:

| No. | Password (Test)       | Complexity Level |
|-----|----------------------|------------------|
| 1   | password123          | Simple           |
| 2   | HelloWorld2025       | Medium           |
| 3   | H3llo_W0rld!         | Strong           |
| 4   | T!g#rL!0n_2025       | Very Strong      |
| 5   | V@9X#pL2qW$r8Z!tM1   | Extremely Strong |

> **Note:** These passwords are for testing purposes only, not for actual use.

## 📊 Test Results

| Password            | Score | Time to Crack       | Feedback                                   |
|---------------------|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| password123         | 25%   | < 1 second         | Too common, lacks symbols, short length    |
| HelloWorld2025      | 50%   | 3 days              | Needs more symbols, predictable pattern    |
| H3llo_W0rld!        | 80%   | 2 centuries         | Strong, could be slightly longer           |
| T!g#rL!0n_2025      | 90%   | 1000+ centuries     | Very strong, good length & randomness      |
| V@9X#pL2qW$r8Z!tM1  | 100%  | Infinite (practical)| Extremely strong, highly random & complex  |

## 💡 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
- ✅ Use at least **12–16 characters**
- ✅ Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- ✅ Avoid dictionary words and personal details
- ✅ Make the password **random**, not based on predictable patterns
- ✅ Longer passwords significantly increase cracking time

---

## 🔒 Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – Tries every possible combination until correct
- **Dictionary Attack** – Uses common word/password lists
- **Credential Stuffing** – Tries leaked username-password combos from breaches

---

## 📈 Effect of Complexity on Security
Password complexity directly impacts security:
- Short/simple passwords → cracked in seconds
- Long/random/complex passwords → may take centuries or longer to crack
- Character variety and unpredictability are key

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Strong passwords are essential for digital security. Following the best practices above significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks.
